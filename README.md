# WnCC-Assignment

**This is the solution to the problem which was asked in the WnCC interview task.**
**Task:** Schedule.txt contains the start time and ending time of different sessions of
      WnCCâ€™s Blockchain Bootcamp. One cannot attend two sessions if they are
      running at the same time. Your program should read the data from the .txt file for
      input and output the maximum number of groundworks one can attend.
      Feel free to create functions or use classes for writing your code. Your code
      should finally print an int displaying the maximum number of sessions that a
      person can attend.
      About the data: The data in the file is in the format: ABCD XX Y, where ABCD
      represents session name, XX represents the start time, and Y represents the
      duration in hours.
